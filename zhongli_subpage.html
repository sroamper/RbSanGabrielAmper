    <h3>Character Story</h3>
    <div>
      <h4>Character Story 1</h4>
      <p>In Liyue, if a person pays great attention to details, and has insuperable 
        criteria by which they judge certain matters, then they are called "particular."
        <br>In truth, everyone is "particular" about something. Some people hate spicy food,
        others don't eat fish, and some want their tofu served sweet...<br>But as for 
        Zhongli, he is particular about everything.<br>He attends operas performed by only
        the most celebrated stars, takes only the most luxuriant thrushes out for walks, and 
        he goes into the kitchen personally to instruct the cooks as to the ratio of shrimp
        and fish required to make the most authentic Fullmoon Egg.<br>Zhongli has expertise
        in all manner of things, from fashion to daily essentials, to fine wines and
        delicacies, to teas and spices, and to flora and fauna. He is also more than capable
        of participating in discussions on commerce, politics, and international relations.
        <br>But on a typical day, all you will glean from him is a few pieces of useless trivia,
        because he particularly enjoys sharing these fun tidbits with you.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h4>Character Story 2</h4>
      <p>When making a purchase, look to haggle.<br>This is a common understanding among the
        people of Liyue. No matter what high heavens the store owner praises their product to,
        no matter its ancient history or classical value, prices are always flexible. Half
        the stated cost is a good place to start.<br>But when Zhongli pays up (or rather, calls 
        for someone else to pay up on his behalf), he never looks at the price tag. As long 
        as it catches his eye, Zhongli will pay as much as the owner asks. Indeed, he will even
        buy it at a premium sometimes.<br>But for some reason, Zhongli always forgets to bring
        money.<br>For small purchases, he has friends to help him out, and large bills he
        somehow finds ways to have written off.<br>To those merchants who secretly pride themselves
        on their powers of flattery, Zhongli is a man of strange proclivities: in truth, he knows
        a great deal about the value of money and finance, and he also understands the suffering 
        of the people. However, he seems to not understand that poverty is part of the human
        condition.<br>Or perhaps it might be said that he cannot imagine himself being poor.
        <br>How has such a person not died of hunger yet?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h4>Character Story 3</h4>
      <p>There is no way Zhongli can starve.<br>Such concerns as profit and loss are beneath his 
        notice. The Seven Nations and the world itself are where his efforts are directed.<br>As 
        for wealth... He is wealth itself.<br>He is Morax, the overlord Rex Lapis who rules Liyue,
        and the Geo Archon of the Seven Archons. The very money that circulates throughout Teyvat,
        Mora, is named after him.<br>When night falls and bustling Liyue begins to slumber, he will 
        sometimes stand atop the towering mountains and gaze upon this city, which he made with his
        own hands.<br>To the people of Liyue, Rex Lapis has many divine titles.<br>When he laid 
        down Liyue's laws by his divine might, he was the God of Contracts. When he minted the first
        Mora and made Liyue strong by dint of commerce, the merchants revered him as the God of
        Commerce.<br>He has lived through countless years and is the eldest of the Seven, and so 
        historians call him the God of History.<br>Thousands of years ago, the forebears of the
        citizens of Liyue Harbor struck stones together to start fires and used piled stones to create
        stoves. These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of
        God of the Stove.<br>People from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of 
        Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.<br>But in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, 
        Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue — the Warrior God — is the most
        fascinating.<br>The delicacies that Rex Lapis discovered while lost in the streets, the plaques
        inscribed with his handwriting, a famous opera that he once starred in, playing the part of a
        warrior... Many stories and tales of Liyue are, when studied closely, stories of people visited
        by their deity at some point — and the citizens of Liyue are most proud indeed of that history.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Character Story 4</h4>
      <p>As the founder of Liyue Harbor, "contracts" are the most important thing to Morax.<br>From simple
        monetary exchange and agreements between merchants to the ancient laws that Morax himself laid down,
        there is no part of city life untouched by "contracts."<br>To merchants, "contracts" are the most 
        important standard to which they hold themselves: deadlines, invoices, shipping destinations... Only
        a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.
        <br>Thus the Qixing punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings
        of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.<br>Through the millennia, every generation
        of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes 
        found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as "permissible 
        if unaddressed," and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by
        the Liyue Qixing.<br>Amid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached
        a whopping 279 pages thick.<br>The person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan
        Ningguang, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the "Tailor of Liyue," in honor of her speed in
        patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.<br>But no matter how complicated or tangled 
        mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.<br>"The one who
        reneges on their words shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock."</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Character Story 5</h4>
      <p>Rex Lapis, most ancient of The Seven, has lived far too long.<br>Rex Lapis still remembers that moment
        when the final archon took their divine seat, thus ending the Archon War and the era of warring gods.
        The Seven were a diverse lot and dispersed far and wide, but they all shouldered the burden of guiding
        humanity.<br>As time passed, many of The Seven's titles changed hands, and only two remain of the first
        Seven: Rex Lapis and the Anemo Archon.<br>The carefree Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, is the second eldest
        of The Seven.<br>When Barbatos first came to Liyue, Rex Lapis believed his fellow archon to have encountered 
        some terrible crisis in pursuit of their duties, thus requiring his aid.<br>So when Barbatos descended in
        a gust of wind, the Geo Archon had already prepared himself to receive this neighboring deity and lend what
        help he may.<br>But as he looked, the Anemo Archon tossed a wine bottle at him.<br>"Here's some wine from
        Mondstadt. Care for a taste?"<br>To forsake one's duty to deliver a single bottle of wine — what a preposterous 
        notion!<br>Yet the Anemo Archon kept coming to visit, to explore Liyue Harbor, all sorts of strange questions
        on his lips. The Anemo Archon's questions knew as little limits as the wine in his hands.<br>From then on, the 
        first Seven would often gather in Liyue.<br>Rex Lapis still remembers how those wines tasted.<br>The world has
        changed much since then, and all that was once familiar has faded into memory.<br>The seven seats changed and
        again were changed, till five of the seven at the table were all departed.<br>Nor would the duty of guiding 
        humanity be honored by the new archons.<br>Even the hardest rocks may be worn down after three thousand years.
        <br>Nor would the wind ever return again.<br>One drizzly day, the ancient ruler was strolling about Liyue 
        Harbor, and overheard a merchant telling one of his workers,<br>"You've finished your duties, go ahead and call
        it a day."<br>Long did he stand amidst the milling crowd.<br>"Have I... already finished my duties?"</p>
